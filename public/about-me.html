        <p><em>I am a Senior QA Engineer @ <strong><a href="https://joshsoftware.com/">Josh Software Pvt. Ltd.</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>
            Working as a Quality Analyst, I have gained experience in manual and automation software product testing. I have been involved in automating API, UI and functional tests using the python pytest framework. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Creating test scenarios and test cases, analyzing the automation test reports, test automation and code review, manual execution of tests, and reporting defects and improvement in the software is the daily routine. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am conscientious and can collect, analyze information, and take proper decisions.
